# Lab01-NumbersGame
This is a numbers game. You will be asked to enter a integer greater then 0 that will represent the size of an array of int's that you are about to
create. After that you will be asked to fill each index spot of this array with an integer.
The program will sum up all the numbers in your array and 
then the program will get a number from you and it will retrieve the value found at that index position.
It will multiply the sum of the array by the value found.
Next the program will get a number from you to divide the product from the previous step by.
Lastly you will get a print out of your array size, the numbers in the array and all the math it just did.
